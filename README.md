# TCE_2022

This repository overviews EDA, Preprocessing and XGB model.

# EDA

- A glimpse introduction on Pandas’ plot method
- How to draw some basic plot, including boxplot, scatter plot, and histogram chart, and more, using Pandas’ plot method
- How to draw a correlation matrix using Pandas (this one is not generated by the plot method, yet it is imperative in any EDA, so I include it too)

# Preprocessing

Why preprocessing?

## Real-world data are generally:

- Incomplete: lacking attribute values, lacking certain attributes of interest, or containing only aggregate data
- Noisy: containing errors or outliers
- Inconsistent: containing discrepancies in codes or names

## Tasks in data preprocessing:

- Data cleaning: fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove outliers, and resolve inconsistencies.
- Data transformation: normalization and aggregation.
- Data reduction: reducing the volume but producing the same or similar analytical results.
- Data discretization: part of data reduction, replacing numerical attributes with nominal ones.

# XGBoost

- Data description
- Hyper-parameter tuning
- K fold Cross Validation
- Grid Search
- Evaluation Metrics
